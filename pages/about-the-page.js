                            <Text>I developed this website using mainly JavaScript with a little bit of HTML syntax required.</Text>
                            <br />
                            <Text>I am using a React Native framework called Next.js to develop the front-end with JavaScript</Text>
                            <br />
                            <Text>For the UI, I am using a library called Chakra UI to build this cool modern and simplistic interface! No CSS even needed!</Text>
                            <br />
                            <Text>I also used Framer Motion to create these extremely smooth transitions when you navigate the different pages on my website!</Text>
                            <br />
                            <Text>I deployed and hosted this website on Vercel.</Text>
                            <br />
                            <Heading as="h2" variant="section-title">Where did I get motivation or inspiration from to create my portfolio website?</Heading>
                            <br />
                            <Text>I had some experience coding HTML website from scratch from EAE and my Front-End Web Development module in Year 1 in Poly.</Text>
                            <br />
                            <Text>However, I wanted to properly develop a website that I can plug in my portfolio as a showcase of my web development skills.</Text>
                            <br />
                            <Text>Personally, I did not find coding everything in basic HTML and CSS from scratch useful for creating my official portfolio website, so I looked into other methods like React!</Text>
                            <br />
                            <Text>I feel that it is a very versatile library that can also be used to develop apps, so I felt that practising coding with React will also allow me to understand better how to develop apps, which will be a skill I will have to eventually learn when I enter the IT industry!</Text>
                            <br />
                            <Text>This website is also heavily inspired by one of my favourite programming YouTubers called "Dev As Life" or Takuya Matsuyama, a Japanese indie software developer. I was inspired by one of his tutorial videos on how to code a website using a React framework, that I wanted to create it as well!</Text>
                            <br />
                            <Text>I would definitely encourage you to check out his YouTube channel! He makes amazing quality and chill programming videos on his channel!!!</Text>
